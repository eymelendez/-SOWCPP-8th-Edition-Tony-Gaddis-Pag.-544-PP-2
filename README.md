2.    Test Scores #1 

      Write a program that dynamically allocates an array large enough to hold a userdefined number of test scores.
      Once all the scores are entered, the array should be passed to a function that sorts them in ascending order. 
      Another function should be called that calculates the average score. The program should display the sorted list 
      of scores and averages with appropriate headings. Use pointer notation rather than array notation whenever possible.   
      
      Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for test scores.    

 3.    Drop Lowest Score 
       
       Modify Problem 2 above so the lowest test score is dropped. This score should not be included in the calculation 
       of the average.
